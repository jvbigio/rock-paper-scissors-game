# Summary

As a self-taught developer, I enjoy building applications on my own and solidifying new concepts learned. I also love finding new challenges to gain new insight and skills. Although this app is simple in design, I had fun working through the little challenges that presented itself along the way. I look forward to building more complex games in the future.
